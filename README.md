#FANNY_C

This project implements the FANNY[1] algorithm using the language C. To compile use `make`, the executable is generated into the _bin_ folder. To run the program simply pass one of the _par_ files (under _cfg_) as parameter. Alternatively, you may drag and drop one of the _par_ files into the executable.
Make sure the _par_ file is properly formatted and that the paths are correct, a template is available in the _cfg_ folder.
